<b>Hello,</b>
<br>

<div align="center">
 Presently employed as a clinic admin manager at a medical office aiming to succeed on obtaining a degree in <b>computer science </b>for a chance to <b><i></i>change careers</b>. In a perfect world, I goal to achieve to graduate then secure a position that is relevant what my education purposes in. I remember the first time I laid my eyes on a computer and learned how to type. The passion was <b>very strong and obvious</b>. I gradually became intrigued by social media as a teenager where I learned how to utilize HTML to produce a pretty themed profile. The passion escalated from there. In my young adult years, I somehow ended up in the medical industry instead of tech. Although, great at managing and understand the protocols that are in place for the clinic, I am not fully fulfilled. I took a leap of faith and ultimately enrolled in computer science.
