Hello, 
My name is Edna Lynn, I am a student here at RTC and I am filipina and japanese. 

I am currently working in the medical industry as a manager of a clinic. I adore witnessing progress from patients who improve themselves and get better. 
However, I aim to experience a different world of work. I decided to take a leap of faith and enroll as a student to learn computer programming. 
I hope to achieve great knowledge in this criteria of expertise. I desire to secure a position that is relevant to what I am learning. 

Thus far I have learned the following languages: 
HTML 
CSS 
PYTHON 
C# 
JAVASCRIPT 
JAVA 
SWIFT 
SQL 

I consider myself a rookie at programming vs to the big leagues but I am learning my way up. One of my favorite projects are: 

A SQL DATABASE ON Makeup School:
